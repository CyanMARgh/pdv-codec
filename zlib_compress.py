# Yes, that's all the python script does. I thought about using gzip or something similar,
# but their compression results are slightly different and I honestly don't understand why.
# The output data coincides by about 99% if you remove the header of the file,
# but where this 1% comes from is an unknown mystery to me, which I don't want to spend
# more time on and donâ€™t see much point in it. If you want - you are welcome.
